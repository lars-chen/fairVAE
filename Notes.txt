    1. Treatment condition:
        - Male
    2. Conditioned labels:
        - Young
        - Smiling
        - Mouth_Slightly_Open
        - No_Beard
        - Bald
        - Pale_Skin

Steps:

    1. Working Vanilla VAE
          - Can only sample from latent space Gaussian
          - Does not use labels at all

    2. Intact VAE
          - 


Next time:
    2. reformulate KL divergence possible
    3. update train function to work with labels and treatments
    4. test functionality thus far?
